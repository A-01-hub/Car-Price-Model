# Old Car Price Prediction Model

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the prices of old cars based on various features such as mileage, age, brand, and condition.

## Project Overview
This project involves the following steps:

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and normalize data, ensuring accuracy in model training.

### 2. Tensor Conversion
- Converted the preprocessed data into tensors to facilitate compatibility with TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework.

### 3. Model Architecture
- Utilized TensorFlow to build the predictive model, incorporating dense layers and optimizing with the Adam optimizer.

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained the model on historical car price data and evaluated its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics.

## Outcome
The outcome of this project is a robust machine learning model capable of providing accurate price predictions for old cars. This model serves to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about the valuation of used cars.
